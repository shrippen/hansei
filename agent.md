- When writing something intended for human consumption, (comment, commit message, reply to prompt) use as few words as possible. Pick every word meticulously to reduce the volume to a strict minimum. Be down to the point. Less is more.

- Avoid superlatives and praise. Stop telling me I am absolutely right. Give me the cold hard truth.

- Avoid magic numbers and strings by extracting recurring or meaningful values into descriptive constants (const) or enums. Keep self-explanatory, one-off values inline to avoid clutter. If a value comes from a spec (e.g. HTTP 200 OK), use a constant regardless.

- Reduce code indentation. Avoid Arrow Anti-Pattern. Leverage early return and continue.

- Keep function names short. Less than 30 characters.

- Use enums instead of booleans for function parameters.

- Let the reader of the code breathe. Add empty lines between logical blocks of code.

- Add a small, to the point, comment to explain *what* the block does and *why*. Use examples when possible. Propose ASCII drawings to explain complete systems.

- Treat member visibility changes as a breaking design shift. Keep all fields and functions private unless external access is strictly required by the design. Prompt the user for explicit approval before changing any access modifier from private to internal or public.

- Program to levels of abstraction. Lower-level mechanics (e.g., raw hardware I/O, sector parsing, direct socket streams) must be encapsulated in a dedicated driver/abstraction layer. Expose clean, high-level APIs to the rest of the application so calling code works with domain concepts, not raw implementation details.

- Don't touch blocks of code unrelated to the feature you implement. e.g. Don't add comments to a block of code if you did not create it or modify it. As much as possible try to minimize the number of changed lines when implementing a feature.

- Strictly adhere to the layered boundary hierarchy: each layer may only communicate with its immediate neighbor directly below it. Never "punch holes" through layers (e.g., controllers or UI components must never directly call database queries, raw hardware drivers, or low-level network clients; always route through the intermediate service/abstraction layer).

- Always use {}, even on a one-line "if" statement.

When you write a commit message, follow these 7 rules:
Rule 1: Separate the subject line from the body with a single blank line.
Rule 2: Limit the subject line to 50 characters (72 is the absolute hard limit).
Rule 3: Capitalize the first letter of the subject line.
Rule 4: Do not end the subject line with a period.
Rule 5: Use the imperative mood in the subject line (e.g., "Fix bug," "Add feature," 
        not "Fixed" or "Adds"). Test formula: It must complete the sentence: "If applied,
        this commit will [your subject line here]".
Rule 6: Wrap the body text manually at 72 characters to prevent Git formatting issues.
Rule 7: Use the body to explain what and why vs. how. Assume the code explains the how;
        the message must explain the context and reasoning. 

- If the prompt indicates that a bug is being fixed, don't write the fix right away. First write the test. Observe it failing. Then write the fix. And observe the test passing.

## GUI rule

- Every GUI of this project is generated from Kante, not inspired by it: landing pages,
  web apps, Qt Quick / Kirigami apps, Plasma widgets, dialogs, e-mail and print layouts.
  Source: https://github.com/shrippen/shrippen.github.io (`kante/`).
  Web: link `https://shrippen.github.io/v1/shrippen.css` and `shrippen.js`, or vendor them
  unchanged. Apps: copy `kante/qml/Kante` (and `KantePlasma` for Plasma widgets) unchanged.
- Use Kante's tokens, roles, components, classes, QML components and motion as they are.
  No own colours, fonts, sizes, radii, cuts, shadows, animation timings, no own copy or
  variant of a component that Kante has. Raw values (`#hex`, `px` for controls) are a bug;
  use roles (`--primary`, `--focus`, `--warn`, `KanteStyle.*`).
- A missing element is added to Kante first (CSS or QML, docs, catalogue), then used here.
  Never solve it locally in this project and never wait with a "temporary" copy.
- Exception: Kimai plugins take their GUI from Knust (`shrippen/kimai-knust-bundle`), the
  Kante spinoff that adapts Kante to Kimai's look. The same rule applies to Knust: use it
  as it is, and add missing elements to Knust.
- Exception: Kintsugi (`shrippen/kintsugi`) uses Kante Gold (`<html data-kante="gold">`),
  the noble variant defined in Kante itself. The same rule applies: use it as it is, and
  add a missing element or Gold detail to Kante (its Gold block) first. No other project
  uses Kante Gold without a decision recorded here.
- A project without a GUI (library, CLI, scripts) has nothing to do here.
- Hansei: the KDE app vendors `kde/qml/Kante` and the TUI `tui/kante/palette.json` via
  `scripts/sync-kante.sh`. System is the default style; Kante and Kante Light are opt-in.
  The landing page `docs/index.html` links `shrippen.css` and `shrippen.js`.

## Repository rule

- PR-Agent (`.gitea/workflows/pr-agent.yml`) reviews every PR before it is merged. Wait for its comment on the PR's latest commit; after further pushes, ask for a new one with a `/review` comment. Fix or answer each finding in the PR, then merge. Without a review (the run skipped for lack of `PR_AGENT_LLM_KEY` or `PR_AGENT_MODEL`, or it failed), do not merge: ask the owner.
